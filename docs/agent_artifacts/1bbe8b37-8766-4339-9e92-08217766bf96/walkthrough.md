# Walkthrough: Adding Missing Images to Sleep Guides Hub

I have successfully generated and added branded, high-quality images to all 10 sleep guide cards that were previously using placeholders.

## Changes Made

### 1. Generated Custom Assets
I generated 10 new images using prompts tailored to the specific content of each guide to ensure a cohesive and premium aesthetic.

**Generated Images:**
- `sleep_with_pets_hero.png`
- `snoring_fixes_hero.png`
- `sleep_stress_hero.png`
- `state_of_sleep_hero.png`
- `insomnia_hero.png`
- `sleep_cycles_hero.png`
- `choose_mattress_hero.png`
- `mattress_firmness_hero.png`
- `bed_sizes_hero.png`
- `clean_mattress_hero.png`

### 2. Updated Sleep Guides Hub
I updated `src/app/sleep-guides/page.jsx` to import these new assets and replace the Unsplash placeholder URLs.

## Verification Results

### Visual Verification
I navigated to the `/sleep-guides` page and verified that all cards now display their unique images correctly.

All images are loading correctly and match the "Premium" and "Rich Aesthetics" design goals.
