# Homepage Copy Update Plan

The goal is to rebrand the homepage messaging to focus on "The Long-Term Durability Authority" and "Living Reviews" as per the user's request.

## Proposed Changes

1.  **Hero Section**:
    -   **Headline**: Change "Wake Up Feeling Refreshed." to "The Long-Term Durability Authority." (or similar strong opening).
    -   **Subheadline**: Focus on 1, 3, 5-year durability tests and "Living Reviews".
    -   **Pill Badge**: Change "Updated for 2024" to "Living Reviews™".

2.  **Trust/Process Section ("How We Test")**:
    -   Update the description to emphasize lifespan performance.
    -   **Cards**:
        -   "Pressure Relief" -> "Simulated Decade Testing" (or similar).
        -   "Motion Isolation" -> "Performance Over Time".
        -   "Temperature Control" -> "Verified Owner Data".

3.  **Features/Stats**:
    -   "Unbiased Reviews" -> "Living Reviews"
    -   "1,000+ Hours Testing" -> "Annual Re-Testing"
