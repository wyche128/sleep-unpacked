# Helix Plus Longevity Review Page Plan

## Goal Description
Create a "Living Review" longevity analysis page for the Helix Plus mattress, designed for plus-sized sleepers. The page will use the project's React component structure and brand identity (Jet Black, Golden Bronze, Graphite, Alabaster Grey).

## Proposed Changes

### Content
- **Component**: Create `src/pages/mattress-reviews/HelixPlusLongevityReview.jsx`
- **Source Material**: Gather specs for Helix Plus (TitanCaliber coils, high-density foams).
- **Cleanup**: Delete `src/pages/mattress-reviews/helix-plus`.

### Tech Stack
- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS (Brand colors)
- Recharts / Chart.js (for longevity graphs)
- Lucide React (Icons)

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- Build verification via `npm run dev` output checking.
### Manual Verification
- Render the page to ensure charts, calculators, and layout look correct.
