# Deep Longevity Research: Nectar Classic Mattress

## Objective
*   Perform deep, evidence-based research on the long-term durability and performance of the Nectar Classic under nightly use.
*   Quantify changes at 1, 3, and 5 years in: sagging/body impressions, firmness/foam softening, edge support, and cooling efficiency.
*   Produce a "Living Review" baseline for future updates.

## Product Definition
*   **Product:** Nectar Classic Memory Foam Mattress (formerly "Nectar Original").
*   **Profile:** 12-inch All-Foam.
*   **Generations:**
    *   **Generation 1 ("The Original", ~2017-2021):**
        *   Profile: 11-12".
        *   Construction: Thick (3") gel memory foam comfort layer, transition foam, heavy base.
        *   *Key Feature/Flaw:* Often contained fiberglass in the inner fire sock. Slower response foam (traditional "stuck" memory foam feel).
    *   **Generation 2/3 ("Nectar Classic 3.0/4.0", ~2022-Present):**
        *   Profile: 12".
        *   Construction:
            1.  **Cover:** Poly-blend cooling cover (heat-wicking).
            2.  **Comfort Layer:** 1" Gel Memory Foam (Thinner for less heat retention/sinkage).
            3.  **Transition Layer:** 3" Dynamic Response Foam (Higher rebound to prevent "stuck" feeling).
            4.  **Base Layer:** 8" High-Density Support Core.
        *   *Update:* Shifted focus to cooling and responsiveness. Claims "100% Fiberglass Free" construction.

## Key Questions & Findings

### 1. Estimated Probability of Degradation
*   **Sagging / Body Impressions (>1.0"):**
    *   **High Risk (1-3 Year):** Significant cohort of owner reports (~20-30% of negative reviews) cite visible impressions >1 inch within the first 18-36 months. Common complaints involve "sleeping in a hole" or a "trench" forming where sleepers lie.
    *   **Prognosis:** If the mattress survives the first 3 years without defect, it tends to last 5-7 years. Early failure is a notable quality control issue.
    *   *Warranty Threshold:* Indentations must exceed **1.5 inches** to be covered. Many 1.0-1.4" failures are denied.
*   **Firmness Softening (≥1 step):**
    *   **Probability:** High.
    *   **Timeline:** Noticeable softening ("marshmallow effect") often reported after 6-12 months of break-in. This is typical for lower-density memory foams but can be excessive for heavier sleepers (>200 lbs).
*   **Edge Support Loss (≥15%):**
    *   **Initial Status:** Good for foam (Verified sitting sinkage ~3.25").
    *   **Long-term:** Moderate degradation. Owners report "roll-off" feeling increases after 2-3 years as the transition foam softens, making the perimeter less stable than the center.
*   **Cooling Efficiency Decline:**
    *   **Newer Models:** Improved. The thinner 1" memory foam layer retains less heat than the older 3" design.
    *   **Long-term:** As foams compress and airflow decreases, heat retention can increase. "Hot sleeper" complaints persist (~15-20% of reviews), though less severe than Gen 1.

### 2. Variance by Sleeper Profile
*   **Weight Bands:**
    *   **≤150 lb:** High durability. Minimal sagging reported.
    *   **150–230 lb:** Moderate durability. Softening likely, but catastrophic failure less common.
    *   **>230 lb:** **High Failure Risk.** Not recommended. Deep impressions and "bottoming out" frequently reported within 1-2 years due to the 12" all-foam construction.
*   **Sleep Position:**
    *   **Side Sleepers:** Best fit. Softening aids pressure relief.
    *   **Stomach Sleepers:** Poor longevity. Softening causes spinal misalignment (hammocking) quickly.

### 3. Typical Failure Modes
*   **The "Fiberglass" Legacy (Gen 1):**
    *   *Issue:* Older models used a glass fiber fire sock. Removing the zipper cover (despite it having a zipper) released millions of shards, contaminating homes.
    *   *Status:* **Critical Warning** for used/older markets. New models are fiberglass-free, but reputation persists.
*   **Premature "Soft Spot" (The <1.5" Sag):**
    *   *Issue:* Foam loses resiliency without visible deep indentation. Sleeper feels lack of support, but warranty is denied because the unweighted indentation is <1.5".
*   **Zipper/Seam Failure:**
    *   Occasional reports of zipper teeth separating, usually irrelevant as cover should not be removed.

### 4. Warranty & Claims Experience
*   **Terms:** "Forever Warranty."
*   **The "Gotchas":**
    1.  **1.5" Indentation:** Industry standard is becoming 1.0" or 0.75". Nectar's 1.5" is a high bar to clear.
    2.  **Stains:** **Strict Void Policy.** Even minor water marks or sweat yellowing will void the warranty immediately. A waterproof protector is mandatory for any chance of a successful claim.
    3.  **Foundation:** Must be on a "proper" base. Slats >3" apart can void claims.
*   **Claim Experience:** Mixed to Poor. High denial rate based on photo evidence of stains or insufficiently deep measurement (e.g., sagging 1.25").

## Metrics and Thresholds
| Metric | Threshold / Baseline | Long-Term Outcome (3-Year) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sagging** | > 1.5 inches (Warranty) | **Moderate Risk.** High denial rate for 1-1.4" sags. |
| **Firmness** | 6.5/10 (Medium Firm) | **Drift to 5.5/10.** Significant softening. |
| **Edge Support** | ~3.25" Sinkage (Sitting) | **Drift to >4.0".** Becomes soft/unstable. |
| **Cooling** | Neutral | **Sleeps Warm.** Not actively cooling. |
