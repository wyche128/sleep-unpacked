# Implementation Plan - Beef Tallow Landing Page

Test converting the "Is Beef Tallow Non-Comedogenic?" blog post into a high-end, beautifully designed HTML landing page.

## User Review Required
None specifically, but style preference is "beautifully designed" and "premium".

## Proposed Changes

### New Files
#### [NEW] [index.html](file:///c:/Users/ewych/Documents/GitHubProjects/admire-age/beef-tallow-landing/index.html)
- Semantic HTML5 structure.
- Sections: Hero (Title + Image), Intro, What is Tallow, Comedogenic Myth, Who Should Try It, Usage Steps, Comparison Table, Final Thoughts.
- SEO tags (Title, Meta Description).

#### [NEW] [styles.css](file:///c:/Users/ewych/Documents/GitHubProjects/admire-age/beef-tallow-landing/styles.css)
- **Palette**: Earthy, premium tones (creams, soft golds, deep moss green or rich brown text).
- **Typography**: sophisticated serif for headings (e.g., Playfair Display) and clean sans-serif for body (e.g., Inter or Lato).
- **Effects**: Glassmorphism cards for sections, smooth gradients, subtle entrance animations.
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first approach.

#### [NEW] [hero-tallow.jpg](file:///c:/Users/ewych/Documents/GitHubProjects/admire-age/beef-tallow-landing/assets/hero-tallow.jpg)
- Generated image of premium beef tallow skincare aesthetic.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Open `index.html` in browser.
- Check responsiveness on mobile/desktop views.
- Verify all text content matches the source markdown.
