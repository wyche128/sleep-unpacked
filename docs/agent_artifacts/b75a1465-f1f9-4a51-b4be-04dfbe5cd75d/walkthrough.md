# Walkthrough - Contact Form Redesign

I have redesigned the contact form near the footer to be more visible by adding a glassmorphism card effect.

## Changes

### Contact Form Visualization

#### [MODIFY] [ContactSection.jsx](file:///c:/Users/ewych/Documents/GitHubProjects/agency-amazing/_/apps/web/src/components/ContactSection.jsx)

- Wrapped the form in a `div` with `backdrop-blur-lg`, `bg-white/10`, and a border.
- Added shadow and padding to create a card-like appearance.
- Adjusted input styles to ensure visibility within the new container.

## Verification Results

### Automated Tests
- None.

### Manual Verification
- Verified in the browser that the form is now contained in a clearly visible, stylish card.
