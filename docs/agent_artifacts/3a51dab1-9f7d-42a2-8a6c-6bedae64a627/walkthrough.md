# Homepage Redesign Walkthrough

I have transformed the homepage into a true "Hub" for your content, featuring actual reviews and sleep guides.

## Changes
-   **Review Data**: Replaced placeholder data with 3 of your top reviews:
    -   **Purple Original**: Focusing on "Back Pain" and "Cooling".
    -   **WinkBed Hybrid**: Focusing on "Luxury Hotel" feel.
    -   **Nectar Classic**: Focusing on "Value" and "Memory Foam".
-   **New Section**: Added a **"Master Your Sleep"** section featuring 3 key guides:
    -   5 Surprising Fixes for Snoring
    -   The Sleep-Stress Vicious Cycle
    -   7 Bed Size Secrets
-   **Navigation**: Updated links to point to the correct `/mattress-reviews` and `/sleep-guides` sub-pages.

## Verification
The homepage now displays:
1.  **"Top Rated Mattresses of 2025"** with real images and data.
2.  **"Master Your Sleep"** with cards linking to your best content.

## Next Steps
-   You might want to add more reviews or guides to the respective hub pages (`/mattress-reviews/page.jsx` and `/sleep-guides/page.jsx`) as you create more content.
-   Consider adding dynamic data fetching in the future if the content grows significantly.
