# Create agents.md

## Goal Description
Create a comprehensive `agents.md` file in the project root. This file will serve as the primary knowledge base for AI agents (and human developers) working on the "Sleep Unpacked" project, consolidating information from `gemini.md`, `brand_guidelines.md`, and the codebase structure. It ensures future interactions adhere to project-specific best practices, tech stack (React+Tailwind), and brand voice.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> This file is intended to guide future AI sessions. Please check if the "Roles" and "Workflows" accurately reflect your preferred way of working.
