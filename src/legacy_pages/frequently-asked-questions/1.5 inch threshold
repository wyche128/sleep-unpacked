For both the Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe and the Leesa Original, the critical indentation depth required to trigger a warranty claim is greater than 1.5 inches.
The 1.5-Inch Threshold
This measurement is a strict industry standard that serves as the legal boundary between "normal wear" and a warrantable defect.
• Brooklyn Bedding: The warranty specifically covers permanent indentations exceeding 1.5 inches, though some older documentation previously cited a 2-inch requirement. Any indentation measuring less than 1.5 inches is explicitly excluded from coverage.
• Leesa Original: The warranty defines a defect as "deterioration causing the Mattress to have a visible indentation greater than one and one-half (1.5) inches".
The "Visible" vs. "Functional" Conflict
The sources highlight a significant challenge for consumers known as the "Performance Gap" or "Hidden Defect".
• Unloaded Measurement: For a claim to be valid, the indentation must be visible and measurable while no one is lying on the mattress.
• Support Loss: Materials often lose their "Support Factor"—the ability to hold weight—long before they lose their physical height. This means a sleeper might experience several inches of "sag" and significant pain while lying down, but if the foam rebounds to within 1.0 inch of flat when they stand up, the claim will likely be denied.
• Verification Method: Owners are typically required to provide photo evidence using a straight edge, such as a broomstick or ruler, across the mattress surface to prove the gap exceeds the 1.5-inch limit.
Comparative Context
While 1.5 inches is standard for these brands, the sources note that some competitors use more consumer-friendly thresholds. For example, Amerisleep and Tempur-Pedic often set their warranty trigger at 0.75 inches, reflecting higher confidence in the density of their materials to prevent sagging.

Analogy for Understanding: Think of the 1.5-inch rule like a pothole depth requirement for a road repair warranty. The road might be incredibly bumpy and uncomfortable to drive on because the asphalt has softened (support loss), but the contractor won't agree to fix it until a hole is physically deep enough to be measured with a ruler while no cars are driving over it.
