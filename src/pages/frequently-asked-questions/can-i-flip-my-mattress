Can my mattress be flipped? Most modern mattresses are not designed to be flipped because they are constructed with specific support and comfort layers from top to bottom. Brands like Helix, Casper, GhostBed, Nolah Signature, Avocado, and Leesa all specify a set top and bottom. However, Layla mattresses are a notable exception, offering a flippable design with a soft side and a firm side. Some Saatva models (Zenhaven, Youth, and Crib) and specific Brooklyn Bedding models (Plank and Propel) are also flippable
